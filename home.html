    <h2>Our Wedding Day</h2>
    <p>
      Our wedding day marks the culmination of our love story and the beautiful beginning of our shared future.
      The heart of our wedding day is the Nikkah, the Islamic marriage ceremony where we come together in the
      presence of loved ones and in the eyes of Allah. It's a moment of immense spiritual significance, filled
      with blessings and joy. Following the ceremony, join us for the Reception, an evening of love, laughter,
      and new beginnings. It's our chance to share our happiness with all of you who have supported and loved us
      along the way. We can't wait to celebrate with you as we step into this new chapter of our lives!
